# 3_Challenge
Module 3 Challenge: Arbitrage:

For this project, we sorted through historical data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp ($BPI) and Coinbase ($COIN). 

We then applied three phases of financial analysis to determine if arbitrage opportunies exist:
1.) Collecting the CSV data in a Juypter notebook file;
2.) Preparing the datasets for analysis by cleaning missing and erroneous data;
3.) A high-level analysis though summary statistics and visualizations; thus allowing for deeper analysis on three specific dates within the data.


## Technologies
This project uses Python 3.7.11.

It uses the following packages:
* Pandas
* Path from Pathlib
* inline dependency from %Matplot


## Usage
The project uses two datasets

1.) 'bitstamp.csv'
Stock data for $BTI from January 1, 2018 through March 31st, 2018.
2.) 'coinbase.csv'
Stock data for $COIN from January 1, 2018 through March 31st, 2018.
